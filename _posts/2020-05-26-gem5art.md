## The Need for a gem5 Framework for Experiments

The gem5 simulator provides rich support for a variety of hardware models and configurations with high complexity.
However, this complexity comes with a compromise.
Having such a tremendous amount of possibilities of using gem5 results in a lack of a standard approach for running gem5 experiments, which in turns results in a steep learning curve for using gem5 as well as making reproducing a gem5 experiment a highly non-trivial process.

Setting up gem5 full system simulation is one example of highly non-trivial processes.
A typical setup for a full system experiment requires the following inputs: a compiled Linux kernel, a disk image containing a Linux distribution and the desired benchmark suite that is compiled, a compiled gem5 executable and a gem5 system configuration.
Each of the components of the above experiment is sensitive to time and environmental changes, and some of them requires a significant amount of time and attention to correctly produce the input.

For example, having Linux kernel that works with gem5 requires significant modification to the default to Linux configuration, not to mention that Linux kernel source code, even though being versioned, there are many versions being released a year.
Thus, it requires a significant amount of time and resource to keep experiment up-to-date with the most recent Linux kernel version.
Another example is creating a working disk image with an installed benchmark.
A frequent approach is to use qemu and manually typing commands to create such a disk image; this approach often requires several hours and lots of human attention and error-prone.
Another factor affects the reproducibility of an experiment is the complier, which is frequently updated over time.

Unlike many other areas of science, we have the luxury of having *carbon copies* of the inputs to our experiments along with a certain degree of *determinism* in the experiment process.
Thus, it is desirable to have a systematic approach for producing and documenting a gem5 experiment; more importantly, it is essential to have a standard approach for running gem5 experiments that allows throughout testing and reproducibility, both for ourselves and other researchers.
