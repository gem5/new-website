## Part 6 Multi Core
For this last part, we go both multi-core and full system at the same
time\! We analyze the performance of a simple application on giving it
more computational resources (cores). We also boot a full-fledged
unmodified operating system (Linux) on the target system simulated by
gem5. Most importantly, we teach you how to create your own, simpler
version of the dreaded fs.py configuration script, one that you can feel
comfortable modifying.
