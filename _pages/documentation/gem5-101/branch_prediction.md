From the ISA, we now move on to the processor micro-architecture. Part
III introduces the various different cpu models implemented in gem5, and
analyzes the performance of a pipelined implementation. Specifically,
you will learn how the latency and bandwidth of different pipeline
stages affect overall performance. Also, a sample usage of gem5
pseudo-instructions is also included at no additional cost.
