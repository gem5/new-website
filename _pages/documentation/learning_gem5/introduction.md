Introduction
============

This is an intro to this tutorial. It says lots of interesting things.

The goal of this document is to give you, the reader, a thorough
introduction on how to use gem5 and the gem5 codebase. The purpose of
this document is not to provide a detailed description of every feature
in gem5. After reading this document, you should feel comfortable using
gem5 in the classroom and for computer architecture research.
Additionally, you should be able to modify and extend gem5 and then
contribute your improvements to the main gem5 repository.

This document is colored by my personal experiences with gem5 over the
past six years as a graduate student at the University of
Wisconsin-Madison. The examples presented are just one way to do it.
Unlike Python, whose mantra is "There should be one-- and preferably
only one --obvious way to do it." (from The Zen of Python. See
`import this`), in gem5 there are a number of different ways to
accomplish the same thing. Thus, many of the examples presented in this
book are my opinion of the best way to do things.

One important lesson I have learned (the hard way) is when using complex
tools like gem5, it is important to actually understand how it works
before using it.

Finish the previous paragraph about how it is a good idea to understand
what your tools are actually doing.

should add a list of terms. Things like "simulated system" vs "host
system", etc.
