Using the default configuration scripts
=======================================

In this chapter, we'll explore using the default configuration scripts
that come with gem5. gem5 ships with many configuration scripts that
allow you to use gem5 very quickly. However, a common pitfall is to use
these scripts without fully understanding what is being simulated. It is
important when doing computer architecture research with gem5 to fully
understand the system you are simulating. This chapter will walk you
through some important options and parts of the default configuration
scripts.

In the last few chapters you have created your own configuration scripts
from scratch. This is very powerful, as it allows you to specify every
single system parameter. However, some systems are very complex to set
up (e.g., a full-system ARM or x86 machine). Luckily, the gem5
developers have provided many scripts to bootstrap the process of
building systems.

A tour of the directory structure
---------------------------------

All of gem5's configuration files can be found in `configs/`. The
directory structure is shown below:

    configs/boot:
    ammp.rcS            halt.sh                micro_tlblat2.rcS              netperf-stream-udp-local.rcS
    ...

    configs/common:
    Benchmarks.py     cpu2000.py     Options.py
    Caches.py         FSConfig.py    O3_ARM_v7a.py     SysPaths.py
    CacheConfig.py    CpuConfig.py   MemConfig.py      Simulation.py

    configs/dram:
    sweep.py

    configs/example:
    fs.py       read_config.py       ruby_mem_test.py      ruby_random_test.py
    memtest.py  ruby_direct_test.py  ruby_network_test.py  se.py

    configs/ruby:
    MESI_Three_Level.py  MI_example.py           MOESI_CMP_token.py  Network_test.py
    MESI_Two_Level.py    MOESI_CMP_directory.py  MOESI_hammer.py     Ruby.py

    configs/splash2:
    cluster.py  run.py

    configs/topologies:
    BaseTopology.py  Cluster.py  Crossbar.py  MeshDirCorners.py  Mesh.py  Pt2Pt.py  Torus.py

Each directory is briefly described below:

**boot/**
:   These are rcS files which are used in full-system mode. These files
    are loaded by the simulator after Linux boots and are executed by
    the shell. Most of these are used to control benchmarks when running
    in full-system mode. Some are utility functions, like
    `hack_back_ckpt.rcS`. These files are covered in more depth in the
    chapter on full-system simulation.

**common/**
:   This directory contains a number of helper scripts and functions to
    create simulated systems. For instance, `Caches.py` is similar to
    the `caches.py` and `caches_opts.py` files created in previous
    chapters.

    `Options.py` contains a variety of options that can be set on the
    command line. Like the number of CPUs, system clock, and many, many
    more. This is a good place to look to see if the option you want to
    change already has a command line parameter.

    `CacheConfig.py` contains the options and functions for setting
    cache parameters for the classic memory system.

    `MemConfig.py` provides some helper functions for setting the memory
    system.

    `FSConfig.py` contains the necessary functions to set up full-system
    simulation for many different kinds of systems. Full-system
    simulation is discussed further in it's own chapter.

    `Simulation.py` contains many helper functions to set up and run
    gem5. A lot of the code contained in this file manages saving and
    restoring checkpoints. The example configuration files below in
    `examples/` use the functions in this file to execute the gem5
    simulation. This file is quite complicated, but it also allows a lot
    of flexibility in how the simulation is run.

**dram/**
:   Contains scripts to test DRAM.

**example/**
:   This directory contains some example gem5 configuration scripts that
    can be used out-of-the-box to run gem5. Specifically, `se.py` and
    `fs.py` are quite useful. More on these files can be found in the
    next section. There are also some other utility configuration
    scripts in this directory.

**ruby/**
:   This directory contains the configurations scripts for Ruby and its
    included cache coherence protocols. More details can be found in the
    chapter on Ruby.

**splash2/**
:   This directory contains scripts to run the splash2 benchmark suite
    with a few options to configure the simulated system.

**topologies/**
:   This directory contains the implementation of the topologies that
    can be used when creating the Ruby cache hierarchy. More details can
    be found in the chapter on Ruby.

Using `se.py` and `fs.py`
-------------------------

In this section, I'll discuss some of the common options that can be
passed on the command line to `se.py` and `fs.py`. More details on how
to run full-system simulation can be found in the full-system simulation
chapter. Here I'll discuss the options that are common to the two files.

Most of the options discussed in this section are found in Options.py
and are registered in the function `addCommonOptions`. This section does
not detail all of the options. To see all of the options, run the
configuration script with `--help`, or read the script's source code.

First, let's simply run the hello world program without any parameters:

```
build/X86/gem5.opt configs/example/se.py --cmd=tests/test-progs/hello/bin/x86/linux/hello
```

And we get the following as output:

    gem5 Simulator System.  http://gem5.org
    gem5 is copyrighted software; use the --copyright option for details.

    gem5 compiled Jan 14 2015 16:11:34

    command line: build/X86/gem5.opt configs/example/se.py --cmd=tests/test-progs/hello/bin/x86/linux/hello

    **** REAL SIMULATION ****
    info: Entering event queue @ 0.  Starting simulation...
    Hello world!
    Exiting @ tick 5942000 because target called exit()

However, this isn't a very interesting simulation at all! By default,
gem5 uses the atomic CPU and uses atomic memory accesses, so there's no
real timing data reported! To confirm this, you can look at
m5out/config.ini. The CPU is shown on line 46:

    [system.cpu]
    type=AtomicSimpleCPU
    children=apic_clk_domain dtb interrupts isa itb tracer workload
    branchPred=Null
    checker=Null
    clk_domain=system.cpu_clk_domain
    cpu_id=0
    do_checkpoint_insts=true
    do_quiesce=true
    do_statistics_insts=true

To actually run gem5 in timing mode, let's specify a CPU type. While
we're at it, we can also specify sizes for the L1 caches.

```
build/X86/gem5.opt configs/example/se.py --cmd=tests/test-progs/hello/bin/x86/linux/hello --cpu-type=TimingSimpleCPU --l1d_size=64kB --l1i_size=16kB
```

    gem5 compiled Jan 14 2015 16:11:34
    gem5 started Feb  2 2015 15:26:57
    gem5 executing on mustardseed.cs.wisc.edu
    command line: build/X86/gem5.opt configs/example/se.py --cmd=tests/test-progs/hello/bin/x86/linux/hello --cpu-type=TimingSimpleCPU --l1d_size=64kB --l1i_size=16kB

    **** REAL SIMULATION ****
    info: Entering event queue @ 0.  Starting simulation...
    Hello world!
    Exiting @ tick 344986500 because target called exit()

Now, let's check the config.ini file and make sure that these options
propagated correctly to the final system. If you search
`m5out/config.ini` for "cache", you'll find that no caches were created!
Even though we specified the size of the caches, we didn't specify that
the system should use caches, so they weren't created. The correct
command line should be:

```
build/X86/gem5.opt configs/example/se.py --cmd=tests/test-progs/hello/bin/x86/linux/hello --cpu-type=TimingSimpleCPU --l1d_size=64kB --l1i_size=16kB --caches
```

    Exiting @ tick 29480500 because target called exit()

On the last line, we see that the total time went from 344986500 ticks
to 29480500, much faster! Looks like caches are probably enabled now.
But, it's always a good idea to double check the `config.ini` file.

Some common options `se.py` and `fs.py`
---------------------------------------

All of the possible options are printed when you run:

```
build/X86/gem5.opt configs/example/se.py --help
```

Below is a few important options from that list.
